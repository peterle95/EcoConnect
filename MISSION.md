A stakeholder with an ideal management approach would oversee an entire group of forest patches that are ecologically linked by seed dispersal, or collaborate with the managers of patches linked with their own, instead of managing linked patches independently (Bodin and Teng√∂ 2012). Similarly, an ideal stakeholder would focus their efforts on a set of sustainability issues that are all influenced by each other, creating virtuous cycles of synergistic management (Folke et al. 2005, Pham-Truffert et al. 2020). Inappropriate or non-ideal management responses are those that address an issue without first attending to its potential feedbacks and interconnections.
